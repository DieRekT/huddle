# Cursor Prompt — Task 1: UI Shell



Implement the Jan 2026 Huddle UI overhaul per docs/huddle_specpack/SPEC.md and UI_COPY.md.



Requirements:

- Default screen is Room Awareness.

- Top bar buttons exactly: Catch Up, Alerts dropdown, A-/A+, Settings drawer.

- No overlapping panels; single primary surface.

- Add Catch Up overlay skeleton (no logic yet).

- Add Settings drawer skeleton (no logic yet).

- Apply Celtics-inspired tokens from docs/huddle_specpack/DESIGN_TOKENS.md.

- Ensure responsive layout: mobile and desktop.

- Use exact copy from docs/huddle_specpack/UI_COPY.md.

- No transcript UI on the primary surface.

- No mic prompts on join.



Output:

- Provide the exact file diffs/edits needed in this repo.

- If refactoring is required, do it cleanly (componentize rather than hack).
